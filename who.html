            hello my name is qian<br/>
            i was born in croydon university hospital<br/>
            on april 10th, 2000<br/>
            now i live in richmond<br/>
            yank county<br/>
            usa<br/>
            i'd fancy a night out at boxpark<br/>
            honestly i'd settle for some morley's<br/>
            but even that seems less and less likely<br/>
            every day<br/>
            the museums here are nice<br/>
            the vmfa has a lot of eggs<br/>
            might not be so sensible to eat them, though<br/>
            i really like to play fifa<br/>
            i'm pretty sure i'm the best at my school<br/>
            since i was elite 3 last fifa<br/>
            in weekend league<br/>
            i used to be somewhat good at overwatch<br/>
            but the game is a very low quality product<br/>
            and since i mained off tank and healer<br/>
            i couldn't ever make it into gm<br/>
            i blame my teammates<br/>
            i take photos sometimes<br/>
            but only on leica<br/>
            with portra 400<br/>
            my favorite food is sushi<br/>
            the gas station type<br/>
            and my favorite animal the penguin<br/>
            bit sad they won't be around<br/>
            for too much longer<br/>
            my favorite tv show is mr robot<br/>
            but i haven't ever seen a robot<br/>
            in real life<br/>
            i really like apple<br/>
            their design is absolutely brilliant<br/>
            but i don't have much money<br/>
            so i can't buy their new macbook<br/>
            even though it seems very nice<br/>
            i got a nintendo dsi in third grade<br/>
            and i don't think i've been as happy since<br/>
            but that was a fun time<br/>
            my hands get very dry during the winter<br/>
            and it hurts<br/>
            a lot<br/>
            i should probably buy some lotion<br/>
            but i keep forgetting<br/>
            i don't think there's much else to say<br/>
            unless i forgot again<br/>
            but lmk if you think of anything<br/>
